## Overview

Motivation:

Making basic and static website was not interesting to me, so I wanted to create something unique with new tools. One day, I found [This website](http://opencontinents.com/) which integrates moving particles and makes it fully interactive. Later on, I knew that Three.js could achive what I wanted.
Therefore, I learned Three.js as well as additional tools that were neeeded for this project.

What you can do:

* Enjoy new experiences and play with interactive 3d models
* Know the projects I have done so far and the skills I have
* Contact me at the end of the website experience

What I learned:

* Coming up with a lot of ideas and finding the right one by trial and error
* Making 3d models with Blender which allows to create more complex models
* Trying a lot of new skills to make whatever I needed
* Structuring the code with JavaScript OOP

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server
